# Blackjack Project - Week 4 Skill Distillery

The BlackjackApp plays a simulation of the game blackjack. The player and dealer both receive two cards. The dealer has a card facing down and a card facing up, showing the value of the card while the player has both cards facing up. The player has the option to hit or stay. Depending on the player's choice, he either receives a card or keeps the card until the dealer pulls enough cards which add up, stopping once the dealer recieves a 17 or more. If the player receives a 21 on the first hand, he automatically wins. If the player receives a 21 and then the dealer receives a 21, they tie. If the dealer receives a 21, the dealer wins. If both players stay, the player closer to or equal to 21 wins, however if they both have the same hand, they both tie.

## Lessons Learned
I implemented a hashmap to create a unique key for each card and later created it in the deck. Learning how to use enums, maps, and connecting the abstract class within the whole program was challenging. Further, having to debug but retracing my steps and figuring out where the logic was going wrong, it helped me to read my code and make corrections so the outcome can be logically correct.
